Given two sorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of sizes n and m in non-decreasing order. Merge them in sorted order without using any extra space. Modify arr1 so that it contains the first N elements and modify arr2 so that it contains the last M elements.

def mergeArraysInPlace(arr1, arr2, n, m):
    i = n - 1  # Index for the last element in arr1.
    j = 0      # Index for the first element in arr2.

    # Iterate from the end of arr1 and the start of arr2, and merge them.
    while i >= 0 and j < m:
        if arr1[i] > arr2[j]:
            # Swap the elements if arr1[i] is greater than arr2[j].
            arr1[i], arr2[j] = arr2[j], arr1[i]
        i -= 1
        j += 1

    # Sort both arr1 and arr2 after the merge.
    arr1.sort()
    arr2.sort()

# Example usage:
arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]
arr2 = [2, 4, 6]
n = len(arr1)
m = len(arr2)

mergeArraysInPlace(arr1, arr2, n, m)
print(arr1)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(arr2)  # Output: [5, 6, 7]
